The plan for "Dinner and a Movie" is to help planning an eventing activities (whether a date night, family vacation, etc).

The layout of the screens is as follows:
    First screen - tab display with "Dinner" and "Entertainment" tabs
    Dinner tab work flow:
        Select food type (segment control at the top of the screen for "Recipes" and "Restaurants")
        "Recipes" shows a list of recipe types
        -> Selecting a food type while in "Recipes" mode goes to list of recipes (filtered by original food type selection)
            Selecting a recipe goes to the recipes details
            Recipe screen should allow for setting a timer to know when to start preparing the food
        "Restaurants" shows a list of restaurant food types
        -> Selecting a food type while in "Restaurants" mode goes to list of restaurants in the area (filtered by original food type selection)
            Selecting a restaurant goes to the restaurant details
            Details screen should be able to call directly or go to website
    Entertainment tab work flow:
        Select entertainment type (movie, play, concert)
        List of events in the area
        Selecting an event goes to the event details
        Event details screen should allow for buying tickets, mapping the location, etc.
        
        
Other thoughts:
    Should there be another tab for "Gifts" to schedule buying flowers, candy, etc?
    Should there be another tab for "Itinerary" to summarize plans/schedule?
    Where does the user enter the time of the date?
    Should the user be prompted for "Review restaurant", "Review movie" or "Review concert" the next day?
