Facebook+Blocks
===============

This is a simple wrapper to the Facebook iOS Library, providing a block- (and NSOperation-) based interface to instead of delegates the official sdk uses.  Specifically, it provides:
	- extensions to the Facebook class to request resources using blocks for completetion (instead of delegates)
	- the resource request is encapsulated in FBRequestOperation, an NSOperation subclass

If you're already using the official sdk it's very easy to switch to these classes; the Facebook wrapper adds methods similar to the ones you're already using.

Advantages of NSOperations allow your code to:
	- enqueue multiple requests, with dependencies
		- for example, get the list of photos in an album, *then* load all the photos, and *when all are* complete update the UI
	- dispatch requests in parallel (quicker), or serially (cellular-data friendly)


Example:

		
		FBRequestOperation *infoReq = [mFacebookApi requestWithGraphPath:@"me" andCompletionHandler:^(FBRequestOperation *request, id jsonResponse, NSError *err) {

				// response for "me":
				// {
				//			"first_name" = Your;
				//			gender = male;
				//			id = 99999999999;
				//			"last_name" = Name;
				//			name = "Your Name";
				//			username = yourname;
				//			verified = 1;
				//			...
				//	}
				// See http://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/api/ for more
				if(!err)
				{
					NSString *userName = [jsonResponse objectForKey:@"name"];
				}
			
		}]; 
		[[NSOperationQueue mainQueue] addOperation:infoReq];

TODO:
	- Block the FBRequestOperation from completion until the provided completion block is also finished
		- currently any dependent operations may begin exexuting in parallel with your completion block
		- this makes it difficult to pass resulting data from one operation to the next
	- Create the FBRequest earlier
		- currently the request is created only when the FBRequestOperation begins
		- this makes it difficult to inspect or modify the parameters of the request
